# Intro-Machine-Learning-Classifiers
We will use the scikit-learn library, which is a higher-level machine learning library that will work with NumPy data, and Pandas, a library that makes it easier to manipulate data. We will explore a variety of classification algorithms, and compare their performance on a “real-world” dataset, which will introduce its own set of challenges.
